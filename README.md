# My Personal Profile Website
## Description
This website was my first project for MIT xPRO's "[Professional Certificate in Coding: Full Stack Development with MERN](https://xpro.mit.edu/programs/program-v1:xPRO+PCCx+R1/)." 
* Bootstrap was used for styling
* I wrote my own JavaScript code instead of using flexbox or Bootstrap on the "Code" page for collapsing the columns in narrower page views.
